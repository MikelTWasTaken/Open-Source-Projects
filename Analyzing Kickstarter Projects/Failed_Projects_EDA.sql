-- Why are these projects failing? Initial observations indicate for the top 10 failed projects,
-- 50% are Nearly funded and 50% are Not Nearly Funded. In the upper 50%, ther are enough backers and they are all close
-- to achieving the goal. A potential hypothesis as to why, could be related to the category type as it is the most common attribute
-- across all funding statuses. More accurately, failure wasnâ€™t necessarily due to a lack of interest but possibly due to 
-- setting overly ambitious funding goals.
